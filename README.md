This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Future Enhancements (Restaurant Owner's Perspective)

To make this Kitchen Display System (KDS) even more valuable from an operational standpoint, consider these enhancements:

### 1. Enhanced Order Prioritization & Workflow
- **Manual Reordering:** Allow kitchen staff to manually drag and drop orders to reorder them based on priority (e.g., a large catering order, a customer waiting).
- **Granular Status Indicators:** Implement more detailed visual cues for order status beyond just "open" and "completed" (e.g., "in progress," "ready for pickup/delivery").

### 2. Item-Level Tracking & Preparation
- **Individual Item Completion:** Track and mark individual items within an order as completed, useful for multi-station kitchens.
- **Recipe/Prep Notes Display:** Ability to attach and display brief prep notes or recipe instructions directly on the order card for complex or custom items.

### 3. Advanced Analytics & Reporting
- **Historical Performance:** Beyond recent orders, track and display daily/weekly/monthly trends for order volume, average prep times, and peak hours to aid staffing and inventory management.
- **Popularity Reports:** Identify top-selling items and categories to optimize menu offerings and stock levels.

### 4. Customizable Display Layouts
- Allow owners to configure the grid layout (e.g., number of columns, grouping orders by type like "Dine-in," "Takeout," "Delivery") to suit their kitchen's workflow.

### 5. Robust Sound & Visual Alerts
- Implement more distinct sound alerts for different events (e.g., a specific sound for a new "rush" order vs. a regular new order).
- Add visual flashing or prominent alerts for orders nearing their time limit to ensure timely preparation.

### 6. Integration with Other Systems
- **Printer Integration:** Option to "print" a completed order ticket to a local kitchen printer for expediting or bagging.
- **POS System Sync:** Deeper integration with the Point-of-Sale (POS) system for real-time menu updates, price changes, and more detailed order information, reducing manual data entry and discrepancies.
